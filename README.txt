This assessment can be viewed by openning index.html from the ./src directory directly in a 
web browser.

Assumptions

The CSS is again organized from top to bottom, base styles and modifications per element.

With this assessment I mostly went to doing only what the assessment asked and no more to save
time to work on the more involved second assessment.

If I had more time I would have organized the CSS more modularly.

I also was not sure the degree to which the HTML needed to be semantic, so I tried to err
on the side of more meta data than less.

Overall it was fun and I hope the results meet expectations given the small period of time I had
available to work on it.

Not much more to say about this assessment it was fairly straightforward.
